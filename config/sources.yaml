# OPEN SOUSVEILLANCE STUDIO - DATA SOURCES CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# This file defines all government data sources to monitor for your instance.
#
# Each source specifies:
# - What to scrape (URL, selectors)
# - How to scrape it (method, authentication)
# - When to check (priority determines frequency)
# - What to extract (document types, keywords)
#
# Sources are organized by TIER (scope) to help prioritize and understand
# which level of government is responsible.

# TIER 1: MUNICIPAL (City/Town Level)
